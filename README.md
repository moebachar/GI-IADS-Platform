# Automated Object Detection Platform

## Overview
Introducing the Object Detection App, a tool designed for efficient object detection workflows. Users can easily import both local and external data in various formats, ensuring compatibility with diverse datasets. The app's advanced cleaning features help maintain dataset accuracy, while its intuitive labeling system facilitates precise object categorization. With built-in preprocessing options like data splitting and augmentation, the Object Detection App optimizes datasets for improved model training. The app also generates detailed reports on data quality, providing valuable insights for users. With a user-friendly interface, the Object Detection App simplifies the object detection process, making it an essential tool for streamlined data management.

## Installation

### Frontend (ReactJS)

For the frontend, you can use npm to install the dependencies. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Backend (Flask)

For the backend, you'll need to set up a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and then run the Flask server.

#### Unix-Based Systems (Linux, macOS)

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install dependencies
pip install flask python-dotenv

# Run the Flask server
python server.py
```

#### Windows

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
pip install flask python-dotenv

# Run the Flask server
python server.py
```

Make sure to replace `frontend` and `backend` with the actual directories containing your frontend and backend code. Also, ensure that your `requirements.txt` file in the backend directory contains all the necessary dependencies for your Flask application.

These instructions should guide users through setting up both the frontend and backend components of your automated object detection platform, accommodating different operating systems.
